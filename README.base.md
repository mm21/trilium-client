# trilium-client

This is an auto-generated client for [Trilium Notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium). It builds an API client using the `etapi.openapi.yaml` provided by Trilium.

The generated `trilium_client`, `docs`, and `README.md` artifacts are packaged and many unused files are ignored.

To install, run:

```sh
pip install trilium-client
```

To build, activate a shell: (recommended)

```sh
poetry shell
````

Then run:

```sh
poetry install --with=dev
scons
````

To clean, run:

```sh
scons --clean
````

Following is the README produced by the generator.
